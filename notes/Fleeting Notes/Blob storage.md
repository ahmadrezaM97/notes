* Blob storage is a type of cloud storage for unstructured data.
* A "blob" is short for Binary Large Object, is mass of data in binary format that does not necessarily conform to any file format.
* Blob storage keeps these masses of data in non-hierarchical storage areas called data lakes.

### What is object storage

* Blob storage is a type of object storage.
* object storage keeps files or blobs in a flat "data lake" or pool with no hierarchy.
* A data lake/pool is a large collection of unstructured data.

* object storage contrast with file storage and block storage
	* File storage
		* keeps data in hierarchical file structure of folders, directories, subdirectories and so on
	* Block storage
		* keeps data in similarly sized volumes of data called blocks.
	* File and block storage are often not flexible enough or scalable enough for modern organization. By contrast, object storage is so scalable that some consider it to be unlimited storage.

### What is a blob

* A Binary Large Object is a collection of data of an arbitarry size.

### Advantage
1. Scalable:
	1. blob storage capacity is practically unlimted.
2. Cloud-native
	1. blob storage is hosted in the cloud.
3. Programming language agnostic
4. Cost-effective
