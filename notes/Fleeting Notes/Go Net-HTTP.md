processing HTTP request with Go is primarily abut two things
	1. [[GO HTTP HANDLER]]  
	2. [[GO HTTP SERVEMUX]]

handler is like controllers in `MVC`, they are responsible for
	1. carrying out your application logic
	2. writing response header and bodies

whereas a `servemux`(router) stores a mapping between the predefined URL paths for you application and the corresponding handlers.
