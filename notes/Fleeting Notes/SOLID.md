### Single Responsibility Principle

```ad-quote
title: Unix philosopy
Do one thing and do it well
```

* two separate aspects of a problem need to be handled by  different module.
	* changes in a module should be originated from only on reason

### Open/Closed Principle

```ad-quote
titile: Robert C.Martin
A module should be open for extensions, but closed for modification.
```

* modules should be written in a way so that we can add new modules or new functionalities in a module without requiring existing modules to be modified
