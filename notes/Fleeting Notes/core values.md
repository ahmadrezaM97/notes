1. I am going to tell you about one of my experience in the first couple of months after I started my work at Divar.
2. It was about my first big and important task, Our estimation for the task was 20 days.
3. It was a quite bit complicated because 
	1. it consists of development in multiple microservices 
	2. in divar, each microservice has it owner, and if you want implement a future in a microservice the owner will review your code for correctness and integrity.
	3. in different teams
4. I designed feature without sharing and discussing what I wanted to do with any one.
	2. It was like I should implement this api in this service and that api on that service  and then I just started coding
6. after two or three days, I realized that I overlooked  important aspect of task, I didn't see some corner cases so I had to rewrite almost evertyhing
7. at the same time  for some part of the task we needed a web page, and the front-end engineer was waiting for me to give him API documentation.
8. So after a one week I almost didn't any progress
9. when my team leader asked my about the task , I explained  the situation
10. she said we need to talk about it  and we had long discussion
	1. she kindly showed my 
		1. when i am supposed to get done a task, I should take the  complete responsibility of the of the task 
		2. And it means
			1. before I started coding I should  have discussed with other engineer about my desing How i want to implement  to get it done on time
		3. I should prepared documentation before start writing code because the fontend engineer could start without documents
		4. She told me my responsibilty is not just writing codes
		5. I should plan, discuss and comunicate about task to get it done in the perfect way 
	2. I learn the meaning of ownership after that
11. Healthy egos
	1. 
12. pursuit of excellence
	1. 
13. feedback obsessed
	1. Giving a feedback
		1. last month I got an merge request and I reviewed it, generally and then 
	2. receiving a feedback
		1. I am going to talk about one important feedback i got from my team leader. 
			1. in the first couple of month after I started my work in `Divar`, a new fresh engineer joined us
			3. obviously, in the first weeks had had lots of question about how systems are working together and stuffs
			4. And I wanted to help him, and show how  him good colleague I am
			5. So every time he asked me about something, I gave him the complete solution or even sometimes I wrote code for him
			6. my team leader at that moment in on our one-on-one meeting told me that was a wrong way of helping your colleague, and that might even stop him from learning how should he figure out his tasks
	3. I am going to talk about my first weeks in `Divar`.
		1. back then, I wanted to get done my task a much as I can to show the team i am good engineer. 
		2. So  I was not really active in our retroseptives
	4. I am going to tell you about 
14. No BS
