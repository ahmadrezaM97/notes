### Problem
```ad-danger
title: Problem 

Establishing a new connection for each request â€” major problem in both HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0

Both HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0 required to open up a new connection for each request
and close it immediately after the response was sent

Eeach time a TCP three-way handshake should occur
