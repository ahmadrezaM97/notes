#### Intro

Historically, the `SRP` has been described this way:

__A module should have one, and only one, reason to change.__

__A module should be responsible to one, and only one,  actor__

Actor: 
	We're really referring to a group, one or more people who require that change.
	We'll refer to that group as an `actor`.

Module:
	The simplest definition is just a source file.
	Most of the time  that definition works fine.
	A modules is just a cohesive set of function and data structures.

That work "cohesive" implies the `SRP`. Cohesion is the force that binds together the code responsible to a single actor.
