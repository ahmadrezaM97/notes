title: HTTP
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

* it's a application-layer protocol.
* HTTP implemented in two programs: a client and a server program.
	The client program and server program, executing on different end systems, talk to each other by exchanging HTTP messages.
* HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange the messages.
* HTTP uses TCP as its underlying transport protcol(rather than UDP)
* HTTP is said to be a __stateless protocol__.
